Devices: The internet connects billions of devices, 
including computers, smartphones, servers, and IoT devices.

Network Infrastructure: It relies on a complex infrastructure of physical cables, 
routers, switches, and data centers.


 Protocols:
TCP/IP: The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are the fundamental protocols.
 TCP ensures reliable data transmission,
  while IP handles routing the packets to the correct address.
HTTP/HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure) is used for accessing websites.

DNS (Domain Name System):
 Converts human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses. 
 This is like a phonebook for the internet.

 Data Transfer:
When you enter a URL,
 your browser sends a request to the DNS server to get the IP address of the website.
The browser then sends a request to the server at that IP address using HTTP or HTTPS.
The server processes the request and sends the appropriate data (like a webpage) back to your browser.
Your browser assembles the data and displays the webpage.
