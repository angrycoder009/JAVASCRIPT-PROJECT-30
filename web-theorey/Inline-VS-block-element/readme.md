block element - > it takes 100% width of page.
inline element ->it container only size of content 

1. Block Elements:
 A block-level element is an HTML element that 
takes up the full width of its parent container or
 the entire width of the page by default.

Always starts on a new line.
Takes up the full width available,
 meaning 100% of the width of its parent container (unless otherwise specified using CSS).
Can have width and height specified (you can control these with CSS).
Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, etc.


2. Inline Elements:
Definition: An inline element is an HTML element 
that takes up only as much width as its content,
 meaning it does not force a new line and can sit next to other inline elements.

Does not start on a new line; it stays "in line" with other elements.
Only takes up as much space as necessary to fit the content.
You cannot control the width or height of an inline element (unless you change its display to block or inline-block using CSS).
Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <b>, etc
